summary: Ancestry allows the records of a ActiveRecord model to be organised in a tree structure, using a single, intuitively formatted database column. It exposes all the standard tree structure relations (ancestors, parent, root, children, siblings, descendants) and all of them can be fetched in a single sql query. Additional features are named_scopes, integrity checking, integrity restoration, arrangement of (sub)tree into hashes and different strategies for dealing with orphaned records.
